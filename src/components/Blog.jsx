            Imagine working on a mobile app, handling your OJT project, and learning new programming languages all at once. Yep, that was me. It felt like doing backflips while riding a roller coaster... with my laptop on.
            <br /><br />
            It was honestly overwhelming at first. But looking back, I‚Äôm really glad I went through it. I didn‚Äôt just learn syntax or memorize commands. I picked up real programming techniques that made my code cleaner and my thinking sharper.
            <br /><br />
            Every bug turned into a lesson. Every challenge helped me grow. If pressure really does make diamonds, then hey‚ÄîI might be starting to shine a little.

            <p>
              I used to think programming and art were miles apart‚Äîone logical, one emotional. But somehow, I found their connection in my own journey. Art taught me flow, patience, and rhythm. Programming gave me structure and logic.
              <br /><br />
              When the burnout hit hard, I picked up my pencil and let the stress melt onto the page. But my journey didn‚Äôt end in the four corners of my screen. Through my service in YFC, I got the chance to go to ICON in Saranggani. I even traded a tour just to attend and I don‚Äôt regret it one bit.
              <br /><br />
              That moment grounded me. It reminded me why I serve. The joy, the energy, the people I came back not just inspired, but transformed. It made me want to lead better, love harder, and live more purposefully.
